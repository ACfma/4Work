This repository represent an example of some of the skills reported in the CV.

In Utility_Scripts you can find some office automation scripts that made my day better at work (I hope that they could help you too :D)

In model_svm you can find a project made for a university exam project which aim was to using machine learning models. In this particular project I focused on the performance comparisons between svm (with unsupervised feature reduction instances like PCA or iterative feature reduction) and a convolutional neural network (deep learning) for finding Alzheimer desease in MRI scans.

The fcc_* files are from the freecodecamp machine learning with python certificate path.
For rock-paper-scissor, kudos to https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-win-over-70-matches-in-rock-paper-scissors-3e17e67e0dab for the simple oop of markov chain which have been updated in order to examine more thean two previous extraction.
